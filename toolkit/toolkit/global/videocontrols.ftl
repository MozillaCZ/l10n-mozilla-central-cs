### These strings are used in the video controls.

# This string is used when displaying the Picture-in-Picture "flyout" toggle.
# The "flyout" toggle is a variation of the Picture-in-Picture video toggle that
# appears in a ribbon over top of <video> elements when Picture-in-Picture is
# enabled. This variation only appears on the first <video> that's displayed to
# a user on a page. It animates out, displaying this string, and after 5
# seconds, animates away again.
